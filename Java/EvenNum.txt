//Given an array nums of integers, return how many of them contain an even number of digits.

class Solution {
    
    public int findNumbers(int[] nums) {
        int count = 0;
        for(int val: nums){
           int length = String.valueOf(val).length();

            if(length%2==0){
                count++;

//most interesting thing here is just the String.valueOf() which converted the int into String. 
//otherwise, it's pretty straightforward
