/*
Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character but a character may map to itself.

Example 1:

Input: s = "egg", t = "add"
Output: true

        int mapt[] = new int [256];
        
        //we can assume s and t are same length
        for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++){
            if(maps[s.charAt(i)]!=mapt[t.charAt(i)]){
                return false;
            }
            //i+1 to avoid inserting 0, as int[] autofills with 0's
            maps[s.charAt(i)] = i+1;
            mapt[t.charAt(i)] = i+1;
