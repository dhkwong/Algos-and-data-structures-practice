/*
You are given a map in form of a two-dimensional integer grid where 1 represents land and 0 represents water.

Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally). The grid is completely surrounded by water, and there is exactly one island (i.e., one or more connected land cells).

The island doesn't have "lakes" (water inside that isn't connected to the water around the island). One cell is a square with side length 1. The grid is rectangular, width and height don't exceed 100. Determine the perimeter of the island.

Example: 
Input:
[[0,1,0,0],
 [1,1,1,0],
 [0,1,0,0],
 [1,1,0,0]]

Output: 16
16 points of water on each side of land 0,1,0 would be 2 points.

My Thoughts: This was straightforward, but just required the ability to understand how to create and check points within a matrix relative to a given point. Aka things like grid.length is how many arrays are in the 2d array, and grid[0].length is the length of any of those arrays. So grid.length = height, and grid[0].length = width.

After that it was just about checking each side, and accounting for counting perimeters if I'm at a wall. Nothing crazy, just required some visualization.
