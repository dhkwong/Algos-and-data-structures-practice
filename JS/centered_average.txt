##Return the "centered" average of an array of ints, which we'll say is the mean average of the values, except ignoring the largest and smallest values ##in the array. If there are multiple copies of the smallest value, ignore just one copy, and likewise for the largest value. Use int division to produce ##the final average. You may assume that the array is length 3 or more.

##centered_average([1, 2, 3, 4, 100]) → 3
##centered_average([1, 1, 5, 5, 10, 8, 7]) → 5


def centered_average(nums):
  
  min = 0
  max = 1
  sum = 0
  
  ##first, find the indexes of the min and max
  for i in range(len(nums)):
    if(nums[i]<nums[min]):
      min = i
    if(nums[i]>nums[max]):
      max = i
      
  ##go through the array one more time, skipping over the indexes of min and max
  for j in range(len(nums)):
    ##if you encounter the min or max index, continue/skip
    if j == min or j == max:
      continue
    ##else, add to the sum
    else:
      sum += nums[j]
  ##divisor variable to create average
  divisor = len(nums)-2
  ##return average
  return sum/divisor
