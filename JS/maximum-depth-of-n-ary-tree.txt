/*
Given a n-ary tree, find its maximum depth.

The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal, each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples).

 

Example 1:



Input: root = [1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6]
Output: 3
